This midterms activity is a simple IT ticketing system. Its features are adding tickets, viewing them, updating ticket statuses, generating reports, and exiting the program.
It contains several conditional statements to ensure that the program wont turn in on itself and just break mid-ticketing. Though it wasn't made in Java GUI. It still is a pretty
cool activity if you ask me.
